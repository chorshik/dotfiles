# Every section that isn't one of the above is interpreted as a rules to

# Messages can be matched by "appname", "summary", "body", "icon", "category",
# "msg_urgency" and you can override the "timeout", "urgency", "foreground",
# "background", "new_icon" and "format".
# Shell-like globbing will get expanded.
#
# SCRIPTING
# You can specify a script that gets run when the rule matches by
# setting the "script" option.
# The script will be called as follows:
#   script appname summary body icon urgency
# where urgency can be "LOW", "NORMAL" or "CRITICAL".
# 
# NOTE: if you don't want a notification to be displayed, set the format
# to "".
# NOTE: It might be helpful to run dunst -print in a terminal in order
# to find fitting options for rules.
